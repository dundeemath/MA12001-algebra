    "text": "This webpage contains the lecture notes for the algebra half of the Mathematics 1B (MA12001) module for University of Dundee.\n\nIntroduction\nThe module MA12001 is split into two halves. This half, which we call “algebra” basically because it isn’t “calculus”, covers several areas. First we’ll see the idea of vectors, which will be familiar to many of you. Then we’ll talk about matrices, which are a way to discuss transformations of vectors. This is a first introduction to a large and important area of mathematics called linear algebra. In the final section of the module we’ll use what we’ve learnt to describe different geometric objects like lines, planes and spheres.\nThese notes all the examinable material within this half of the module, and maybe also some bonus stuff, which will be clearly marked as non-examinable. For details of the organisation of the module this year, please see My Dundee."

    "title": "Week 1: Displacement Vectors",
    "section": "Displacements",
    "text": "Displacements\nWe proceed initially by considering the particular case of displacement vectors.\nWe begin by using notation for “directed line segments”: if we start at \\(A\\) and displace to \\(B\\), we denote this displacement vector by \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\). The arrow shows the direction and the length is denoted by \\(|{\\overrightarrow{AB}}|\\).\nNote that though these are vectors, there are no numbers in this section. Later we will see how this is linked to vector notation, and column vectors, that you may hae seen before.2\nAn example of a displacement vector is a distance 10 miles in a North-Westerly direction. Note that the displacement vector is not located at a position in space (or on the map) but precisely defines a displacement from any point.\nWe can define what operations we want our displacements to have, like addition and multiplication. How can we do this in a consistent and intuitive way?\n\nEquality\nTwo displacements are equal if their lengths and directions are equal.\nIn the diagram Figure 1 below, \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} = {\\overrightarrow{BC}}\\) because the directions and lengths are the same, even though the endpoints are different. On the other hand, \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} \\ne {\\overrightarrow{DA}}\\) because even though the lengths are the same, \\(|{\\overrightarrow{AD}}| = |{\\overrightarrow{DA}}|\\), the directions are not.\nThink: is \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) equal to \\({\\overrightarrow{CD}}\\) or \\({\\overrightarrow{DC}}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\({\\overrightarrow{CD}}\\) has the opposite direction. \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{DC}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A parallelogram \\(ABCD\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding displacements\nAdding displacements is easy when the endpoint of the first displacement is the startpoint of the second. Consider this diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A triangle \\(ADF\\)\n\n\n\nHere we see that going from \\(D\\) to \\(A\\) and then from \\(A\\) to \\(F\\) is the same as going directly from \\(D\\) to \\(F\\). So we write \\({\\overrightarrow{DA}} + {\\overrightarrow{AF}} = {\\overrightarrow{DF}}\\).\nWithout knowing anything about the points \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\), we can say that \\({\\overrightarrow{XY}}+{\\overrightarrow{YZ}}={\\overrightarrow{XZ}}\\). We just “cancel” the middle letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo add two displacements with a common letter in the midddle, just cancel out that letter.\n\n\nIf there is no common middle letter, then we just need to remember that the displacements do not have a fixed position – we can “move” them. Sometimes it helps if we know other equivalent displacements. For example, in Figure 1, \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\).\nThink: In Figure 1, what one displacement is equal to \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}} + {\\overrightarrow{DB}}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\({\\overrightarrow{BC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}}\\) so \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}} +{\\overrightarrow{DB}}= {\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nTriangle inequality\nWhen we add displacements, the length of the result is NOT the two lengths added together, in general. It is not true that \\(|{\\overrightarrow{DA}}|+|{\\overrightarrow{AF}}|=|{\\overrightarrow{DF}}|\\). In fact, thinking about Figure 2 we can see that \\(|{\\overrightarrow{DA}}|+|{\\overrightarrow{AF}}|\\geq|{\\overrightarrow{DF}}|\\). This is called the triangle inequality.\n\n\nAddition is commutative\nIn mathematics we use special words to describe different operations. An operation is commutative if we can swap around the sides and get the same answer. For example, \\(2+5 = 5+2\\), so normal addition of scalars is commutative. That’s true of vector addition too!\nThink: of the other basic operations of scalars, \\(-\\), \\(\\times\\) and \\(\\div\\), which is commutative and which are not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication is commutative, but subtraction and division are not: \\(3-2=1\\) but \\(2-3=-1\\) and \\(10\\div2 = 5\\) but \\(2\\div10 = 0.2\\).\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1, \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\), and using the fact that \\({\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) and \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} = {\\overrightarrow{BC}}\\), we see that \\({\\overrightarrow{DC}} + {\\overrightarrow{AD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\), so we have proven that \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{DC}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\nAddition is associative\nAn operation is associative if it doesn’t matter where we write brackets. For example, \\((3+2) + 5 = 3 + (2+5)\\). For associative operations, we don’t need to write the brackets at all, and it’s unambiguous to say “three plus five plus two”. (This isn’t true of subtraction. If someone said “ten minus two minus one” would the answer be 7 or 9? \\((10-2)-1\\) is not the same as \\(10-(2-1)\\).)\nLooking at Figure 1, we see that \\(({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}) + {\\overrightarrow{CD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}} + {\\overrightarrow{CD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}}\\), and \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + ({\\overrightarrow{BC}} + {\\overrightarrow{CD}}) = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}}\\). Therefore, we have proven that \\(({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}) + {\\overrightarrow{CD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + ({\\overrightarrow{BC}} + {\\overrightarrow{CD}})\\). Addition of displacements is associative.\n\n\nThe zero displacement\nWith normal scalar numbers, we have the special number \\(0\\) which we can add to anything and not change the answer. \\(3+0=3\\), \\(0+10=10\\), etc.\nWe define a special displacement, denoted \\({\\mathbf{0}}\\), which we can add to any displacement and not change the answer. \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\mathbf{0}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), and also, by commutativity, \\({\\mathbf{0}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\). We think of this displacement as starting at any point, and then not moving!\n\n\nNegative displacements\nEvery normal positive number has a corresponding negative number, and these have the special property that they add together to give \\(0\\). That is to say, \\(3+(-3) = 0\\).\nWe would like to have the same thing with displacements. What displacement can I add to \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) to get the zero displacement, i.e. to get back to where I started? Obviously, we should choose \\({\\overrightarrow{BA}}\\). So, \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BA}} = {\\mathbf{0}}\\), and we write that \\(-{\\overrightarrow{BA}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo take the negative of a displacement, just swap the letters round.\n\n\n\n\nSubtracting displacements\nWe define subtraction using the negatives in the obvious way, so \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} - {\\overrightarrow{CB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + (-{\\overrightarrow{CB}}) = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}\\).\n\n\n\nMultiplying displacements\nFor now, let’s ignore the idea of multiplying two displacements together, and instead concentrate on multiplying displacements by scalars.\nWe can define multiplication by an integer in an obvious way: \\[\n3{\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFor normal numbers \\(ab\\), \\(a\\times b\\) and \\(a\\cdot b\\) are all the same thing. For vectors, we save the dot and cross for special meanings, and only ever use the first notation for multiplication of a scalar and a vector.\n\n\nHere the result of \\(3{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) is clearly in the same direction as \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), and it has three times the length. So in general, multiplying by a scalar results in a displacement in the same direction, but with the length changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo multiply a displacement by a negative number, first multiply by the positive number and then flip the direction.\n\n\n\nScalar multiplication is distributive over vector addition\nNow for some more jargon: an operation are distributive over another operation if we can expand out the brackets. So for normal multiplication and addition, \\(3\\times(5+2) = 3\\times 5+3\\times 2\\).\nWhat about for displacments? \\[\n2{\\overrightarrow{AB}} + 2{\\overrightarrow{XY}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} = ({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}}) + ({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}}) = 2({\\overrightarrow{AB}}+{\\overrightarrow{XY}}).\n\\]\nThink: which of the other rules have we used in this derivation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo write \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}}\\), we have used commutativity of addition. To add the brackets in, we used associativity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The vector \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\) is twice the length of \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) and in the same direction, so \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}=2{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, we see that \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}}={\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), so \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}={\\overrightarrow{AB}}+{\\overrightarrow{BC}}=2{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\n\nDividing by a scalar\nWe’ve defined addition, subtraction and multiplication. What about division? To divide a vector by \\(2\\), just multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n\nColinear points\nThree (or more) points are colinear (they lie on the same line) if all the vectors between them are in the same or opposite directions, i.e. they can all be written as scalar multiples of each other.\nIn Figure 3, points \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are colinear because \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}=2{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), or alternatively \\({\\overrightarrow{CA}}=2{\\overrightarrow{CB}}\\).\n\n\nExamples for displacements\n\nExample: Colinear points\nLet \\(A,B,C\\) be colinear, and \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} = \\alpha {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\), for \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\).\nAlso, let \\(|{\\overrightarrow{AB}}| = \\lambda\\) and \\(|{\\overrightarrow{BC}}| = \\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 4 we see that \\(|{\\overrightarrow{AC}}| = \\lambda+ \\mu\\). What is \\(\\alpha\\)?\nNow \\(| {\\overrightarrow{AB}} | = \\alpha |{\\overrightarrow{AC}}|\\), so that Thus \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}= \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+ \\mu}\\right) {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\). Similary \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}}= \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda+ \\mu}\\right) {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\).\n\n\nExample: Parallelogram\nLet \\(RSTU\\) be a parallelogram (see Figure 5), and extend \\(RU\\) to \\(A\\) so that \\({\\overrightarrow{RU}} = {\\overrightarrow{UA}}\\). Also let \\(C\\) be the mid-point of \\(UT\\). Prove that \\(C\\) is the midpoint of \\(SA\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\nWe have \\[{\\overrightarrow{SA}} = {\\overrightarrow{SR}} + {\\overrightarrow{RA}} = {\\overrightarrow{TU}} + {\\overrightarrow{RA}} = 2\\,{\\overrightarrow{CU}} + 2\\, {\\overrightarrow{UA}} = 2 ({\\overrightarrow{CU}}+{\\overrightarrow{UA}})= 2\\, {\\overrightarrow{CA}}.\n\\] Thus \\(S,C,A\\) are colinear, and \\(C\\) is the mid-point of \\(SA\\).",

So, \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BA}} = {\\mathbf{0}}\\), and we write that \\(-{\\overrightarrow{BA}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo take the negative of a displacement, just swap the letters round.\n\n\n\n\nSubtracting displacements\nWe define subtraction using the negatives in the obvious way, so \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} - {\\overrightarrow{CB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + (-{\\overrightarrow{CB}}) = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}\\).",

    "text": "Multiplying displacements\nFor now, let’s ignore the idea of multiplying two displacements together, and instead concentrate on multiplying displacements by scalars.\nWe can define multiplication by an integer in an obvious way: \\[\n3{\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFor normal numbers \\(ab\\), \\(a\\times b\\) and \\(a\\cdot b\\) are all the same thing. For vectors, we save the dot and cross for special meanings, and only ever use the first notation for multiplication of a scalar and a vector.\n\n\nHere the result of \\(3{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) is clearly in the same direction as \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), and it has three times the length. So in general, multiplying by a scalar results in a displacement in the same direction, but with the length changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo multiply a displacement by a negative number, first multiply by the positive number and then flip the direction.\n\n\n\nScalar multiplication is distributive over vector addition\nNow for some more jargon: an operation are distributive over another operation if we can expand out the brackets. So for normal multiplication and addition, \\(3\\times(5+2) = 3\\times 5+3\\times 2\\).\nWhat about for displacments? \\[\n2{\\overrightarrow{AB}} + 2{\\overrightarrow{XY}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} = ({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}}) + ({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}}) = 2({\\overrightarrow{AB}}+{\\overrightarrow{XY}}).\n\\]\nThink: which of the other rules have we used in this derivation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo write \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{XY}}\\), we have used commutativity of addition. To add the brackets in, we used associativity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The vector \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\) is twice the length of \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) and in the same direction, so \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}=2{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, we see that \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}}={\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), so \\({\\overrightarrow{AC}}={\\overrightarrow{AB}}+{\\overrightarrow{BC}}=2{\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).",
