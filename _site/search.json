Well \\({\\mathbf{b}} = \\lambda {\\mathbf{a}}\\) is a vector in the right direction. Using the rules above, it has magnitude \\(|{\\mathbf{b}}|=|\\lambda{\\mathbf{a}}| = |\\lambda| |{\\mathbf{a}}|\\).

This half, which we call “algebra” basically because it isn’t “calculus”, covers several areas. First we’ll see the idea of vectors, which will be familiar to many of you. Then we’ll talk about matrices, which are a way to discuss transformations of vectors. This is a first introduction to a large and important area of mathematics called linear algebra. In the final section of the module we’ll use what we’ve learnt to describe different geometric objects like lines, planes and spheres.\nThese notes all the examinable material within this half of the module, and maybe also some bonus stuff, which will be clearly marked as non-examinable. For details of the organisation of the module this year, please see My Dundee.",

Common examples are displacement, force, acceleration and velocity 1.\nA vector space is associated with a dimension.

    "section": "Adding displacements",
    "text": "Adding displacements\nAdding displacements is easy when the endpoint of the first displacement is the startpoint of the second. Consider this diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A triangle \\(ADF\\)\n\n\n\nHere we see that going from \\(D\\) to \\(A\\) and then from \\(A\\) to \\(F\\) is the same as going directly from \\(D\\) to \\(F\\). So we write \\({\\overrightarrow{DA}} + {\\overrightarrow{AF}} = {\\overrightarrow{DF}}\\).\nWithout knowing anything about the points \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\), we can say that \\({\\overrightarrow{XY}}+{\\overrightarrow{YZ}}={\\overrightarrow{XZ}}\\). We just “cancel” the middle letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo add two displacements with a common letter in the midddle, just cancel out that letter.\n\n\nIf there is no common middle letter, then we just need to remember that the displacements do not have a fixed position – we can “move” them. Sometimes it helps if we know other equivalent displacements. For example, in Figure 1, \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\).\nThink: In Figure 1, what one displacement is equal to \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}} + {\\overrightarrow{DB}}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\({\\overrightarrow{BC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}}\\) so \\({\\overrightarrow{BC}} +{\\overrightarrow{DB}}= {\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nTriangle inequality\nWhen we add displacements, the length of the result is NOT the two lengths added together, in general. It is not true that \\(|{\\overrightarrow{DA}}|+|{\\overrightarrow{AF}}|=|{\\overrightarrow{DF}}|\\). In fact, thinking about Figure 2 we can see that \\(|{\\overrightarrow{DA}}|+|{\\overrightarrow{AF}}|\\geq|{\\overrightarrow{DF}}|\\). This is called the triangle inequality.\n\n\nAddition is commutative\nIn mathematics we use special words to describe different operations. An operation is commutative if we can swap around the sides and get the same answer. For example, \\(2+5 = 5+2\\), so normal addition of scalars is commutative. That’s true of vector addition too!\nThink: of the other basic operations of scalars, \\(-\\), \\(\\times\\) and \\(\\div\\), which is commutative and which are not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication is commutative, but subtraction and division are not: \\(3-2=1\\) but \\(2-3=-1\\) and \\(10\\div2 = 5\\) but \\(2\\div10 = 0.2\\).\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1, \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\), and using the fact that \\({\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) and \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} = {\\overrightarrow{BC}}\\), we see that \\({\\overrightarrow{DC}} + {\\overrightarrow{AD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}}\\), so we have proven that \\({\\overrightarrow{AD}} + {\\overrightarrow{DC}} = {\\overrightarrow{DC}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\nAddition is associative\nAn operation is associative if it doesn’t matter where we write brackets. For example, \\((3+2) + 5 = 3 + (2+5)\\). For associative operations, we don’t need to write the brackets at all, and it’s unambiguous to say “three plus five plus two”. (This isn’t true of subtraction. If someone said “ten minus two minus one” would the answer be 7 or 9? \\((10-2)-1\\) is not the same as \\(10-(2-1)\\).)\nLooking at Figure 1, we see that \\(({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}) + {\\overrightarrow{CD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AC}} + {\\overrightarrow{CD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}}\\), and \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + ({\\overrightarrow{BC}} + {\\overrightarrow{CD}}) = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AD}}\\). Therefore, we have proven that \\(({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}) + {\\overrightarrow{CD}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + ({\\overrightarrow{BC}} + {\\overrightarrow{CD}})\\). Addition of displacements is associative.\n\n\nThe zero displacement\nWith normal scalar numbers, we have the special number \\(0\\) which we can add to anything and not change the answer. \\(3+0=3\\), \\(0+10=10\\), etc.\nWe define a special displacement, denoted \\({\\mathbf{0}}\\), which we can add to any displacement and not change the answer. \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\mathbf{0}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\), and also, by commutativity, \\({\\mathbf{0}} + {\\overrightarrow{AB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\). We think of this displacement as starting at any point, and then not moving!\n\n\nNegative displacements\nEvery normal positive number has a corresponding negative number, and these have the special property that they add together to give \\(0\\). That is to say, \\(3+(-3) = 0\\).\nWe would like to have the same thing with displacements. What displacement can I add to \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\) to get the zero displacement, i.e. to get back to where I started? Obviously, we should choose \\({\\overrightarrow{BA}}\\). So, \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BA}} = {\\mathbf{0}}\\), and we write that \\(-{\\overrightarrow{BA}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo take the negative of a displacement, just swap the letters round.\n\n\n\n\nSubtracting displacements\nWe define subtraction using the negatives in the obvious way, so \\({\\overrightarrow{AB}} - {\\overrightarrow{CB}} = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + (-{\\overrightarrow{CB}}) = {\\overrightarrow{AB}} + {\\overrightarrow{BC}}\\).",

Obviously for 2D we write \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) instead.",

    "text": "Pythagoras’s rule\nWe haven’t yet defined the magnitude of a general vector. What is the magnitude of \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)?\nFrom the rules so far, we know that \\[ \\left|\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\right| = \\left|5\\hat{{\\mathbf{x}}}+2\\hat{{\\mathbf{y}}}\\right| \\leq |5\\hat{{\\mathbf{x}}}| + |2\\hat{{\\mathbf{y}}}| = 5|\\hat{{\\mathbf{x}}}| + 2|\\hat{{\\mathbf{y}}} = 5\\times1 + 2\\times1 = 7\\] but that just tells us that \\(\\left|\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\right|\\leq 7\\). This isn’t enough.\nActually there are lots of possible choices. In this module, we focus on normal, ‘flat’, Euclidean space: \\[\\left|\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\right| = \\sqrt{5^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{29}\\] which is less than 7, as expected.\nThen general rule is: \\[|{\\mathbf{a}}| = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2}\\] and in 3D \\[|{\\mathbf{b}}| = \\sqrt{b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2}\\].\nTo convince yourself these are good definition, draw a diagram and use Pythagoras’s theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe magnitude of a vector is the square root of the components squared and added up.\n\n\nThink: what is the magnitude of the vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -6 \\\\ -3\\end{bmatrix}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sqrt{2^2 + (-6)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 36 + 9} = \\sqrt{49} = 7.\\]\nDon’t let the negatives confuse you!",
